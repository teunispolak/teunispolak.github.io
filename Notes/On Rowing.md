Marinus van Holst was a mechanical engineer and professor emeritus at Delft University of Technology. He was also a member of the Dutch rowing clubs Nautilus and De Laak. Combining his interests in mechanical engineering and rowing, Marinus published various articles on mechanics in rowing. Marinus passed away in 2019, at 86 years of age.



His website "On Rowing" contained a collection of his articles but can no longer be found at its original address http://home.hccnet.nl/m.holst/RoeiWeb. As the site contained valuable information and is referenced from various places on the internet, I decided to reconstruct it from the pages collected by the Internet Archive Wayback Machine.

A copy of the original website can now be found at [https://teunispolak.github.io/home.hccnet.nl/m.holst/RoeiWeb](https://teunispolak.github.io/home.hccnet.nl/m.holst/RoeiWeb)
